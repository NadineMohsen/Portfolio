# Portfolio

## My Task

Create a Portfolio that can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

This portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

## What does this portfolio includes

* My name
* A recent photo of me
* About-me section
* Sample of my previous work
* Links to each application
* My Resume
